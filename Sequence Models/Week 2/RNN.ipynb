    "\n",
    "RNNs can be efficient for tasks such as machine translation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had to use an n-gram model, the amount of space that will be captures by the matrices is huge. In order to properly calculate longer order of dependencies, higher n-grams have to be stored. This can become burdensome, and developers will not prefer this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Nour was supposed to study with me. I called her but she did not ---- . n-grams are limited to looking only at the previous n words, but RNNs propagate the data further form the beginnning of the sentence to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-To-One : Takes a set of n non-realted features x and returns a single value y.\n",
    "RNNs are not that useful for this kind of task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One-To-Many: Generating Captions from Images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Many-To-One: Sentiment Analysis\n",

    "### Math behind RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "h^\\<t\\> = g(W_h[h^\\<t-1\\>,x^\\<t\\>] + b_h)\n",
    "\n",
    "y^\\<t\\> = Activation g(W_yh h\\<t\\> + b_y)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Function for RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss can be found using the cross entropy function, averaged over time.\n",
